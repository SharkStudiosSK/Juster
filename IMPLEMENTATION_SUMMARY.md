# Juster Animation Software - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Completed Implementation

This implementation successfully delivers a **main menu with project management** and **basic 2D animation tools** as requested. The software is built using C++ with SDL2, OpenGL, and Dear ImGui for a professional interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Application**: Main application lifecycle management
- **UIManager**: Dear ImGui integration and UI component management  
- **Window**: SDL2 window management with OpenGL context
- **Renderer**: OpenGL rendering system

### Animation System
- **Project**: Project management with save/load, canvas settings
- **Timeline**: Layer-based animation with keyframes and playback controls
- **AnimationTools**: 2D drawing tools (shapes, transforms, selection)
- **MainMenuUI**: Complete menu system for project operations

## 🎨 Features Implemented

### Main Menu System
- **File Menu**: New Project, Open Project, Save Project, Save As, Quit
- **Edit Menu**: Undo/Redo (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Animation Menu**: Play, Pause, Stop playback controls
- **Help Menu**: About dialog (placeholder)

### Project Management
- ✅ Create new projects with custom names
- ✅ Project properties (canvas dimensions, frame rate)
- ✅ Dirty state tracking for unsaved changes
- ✅ Save/Load functionality with structured format
- ✅ Project info display with modification indicators

### Timeline & Animation
- ✅ Layer-based animation system
- ✅ Keyframe management with time positioning
- ✅ Layer visibility and opacity controls
- ✅ Playback controls (Play, Pause, Stop)
- ✅ Configurable duration and frame rate (24 FPS default)
- ✅ Timeline scrubber for time navigation

### 2D Animation Tools
- ✅ **Select Tool**: Object selection and manipulation
- ✅ **Rectangle Tool**: Create rectangular shapes
- ✅ **Circle Tool**: Create circular shapes  
- ✅ **Brush Tool**: Freehand drawing (placeholder)
- ✅ **Transform Tool**: Object transformation (placeholder)

### Shape System
- ✅ Base Shape class with inheritance
- ✅ Rectangle and Circle shape implementations
- ✅ OpenGL-based rendering with selection highlighting
- ✅ Shape properties (position, color, dimensions)
- ✅ Interactive canvas with mouse input handling

### UI Components
- ✅ Professional interface using Dear ImGui
- ✅ Toolbar with tool selection buttons
- ✅ Properties panel for shape editing
- ✅ Color picker with RGB controls
- ✅ Project information window
- ✅ Timeline window with layer management

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Build System
- CMake-based build configuration
- Dependency management for SDL2, OpenGL, GLEW
- Git submodule integration for Dear ImGui
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Code Quality
- Clean C++17 implementation
- Header/source separation
- Namespace organization (`Juster::`)
- RAII memory management with smart pointers
- Proper error handling and logging
