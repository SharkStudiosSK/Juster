# Juster Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the core architecture and design principles for Juster animation software. As the project is in early development, this document will evolve over time.

## Core Architecture

Juster will be based on a modular architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Core Engine
- Resource management
- Event system
- Plugin infrastructure
- Settings and configuration

### 2. Renderer
- OpenGL-based rendering
- Vector graphics support
- Raster graphics integration
- Compositing system

### 3. Animation System
- Timeline management
- Keyframing system
- Animation curves and interpolation
- Bone/rig system

### 4. User Interface
- Custom UI framework
- Tool system
- Panels and workspaces
- Themes and customization

## Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: Animation software requires real-time performance for a good user experience
2. **Modular Design**: Components should be loosely coupled to enable easy maintenance and extension
3. **Intuitive UX**: The interface should be approachable for beginners but powerful for professionals
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin system to allow the community to extend functionality

## File Format

Juster will use a custom file format (.jstr) with the following characteristics:
- XML-based structure for readability and ease of debugging
- Binary data blocks for efficient storage of raster and vector data
- Version control compatible (avoid binary-only formats)

## Rendering Pipeline

1. Scene graph building
2. Vector path processing
3. Rasterization
4. Compositing
5. Post-processing
6. Display

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++17
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 3.3+
- **UI**: Custom UI system (potentially with ImGui for development tools)
- **Math**: Custom math library or GLM
- **Image Processing**: Custom or library (TBD)
