## Project Vision

Juster aims to be a free, open-source, community-maintained animation software designed for both beginners and professionals. Our goal is to create an intuitive yet powerful animation tool that makes animation accessible to everyone without compromising on features.

> **Note:** Juster is currently in early development. Many features are planned but not yet implemented.

## Current Development Status

As of February 2025, Juster is in the early development stage. We are:

- [x] Setting up the core architecture
- [ ] Implementing the basic rendering engine
- [ ] Designing the user interface
- [ ] Building the animation timeline system

## Planned Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly design that doesn't sacrifice functionality
- **Vector Animation**: Create smooth, scalable vector animations
- **Raster Support**: Import and animate raster graphics
- **Timeline Editor**: Precise control over your animation sequence
- **Bone System**: Advanced rigging capabilities
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality with custom plugins
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, animators, and testers! Here's how you can help:

- **Developers**: Help implement features and fix bugs
- **Designers**: Contribute to UI/UX design
- **Animators**: Provide insights on workflow and needed features
- **Everyone**: Test, report issues, and suggest improvements
